        <p>    Tile LaunchPad is a tool you can use to quickly run your favorite programs, open documents or folders, and go to URLs (it will launch your default browser to open these). It also supports shell shortcuts. It works similarly to the tiles in the Windows 10 Start Menu, but does not support drag and drop and does NOT support Live Tiles. The tiles are initially empty and you fill them with your favorite items. You can expand the number of rows and columns up to a maximum of 50 rows and 100 columns (5000 tiles).
        <p>
        <p>    Tiles LaunchPad is a completely free program. It does not have advertisements and does not collect user data. I wrote it for my own use and decided to share it. Enjoy.
